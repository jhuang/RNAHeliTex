one distinguishes between haipin loops, bulge and internal loops and multiloops

(this can be explained by the existence of modified bases in native RNAs, which leads to the formulation of a structure that is not the optimal under the energy model used.),

by Zucker in 1989, he extended his algorithm so that it can search a group of  [compute all suboptimal structures with a range.]

  %\begin{block}
    RNA has different structural components:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item single-stranded regions (SS)
    \item hairpin loops (HL)
    \item stacking regions (SR) = Stem
    \item bulges on 5\'{}side (BL) or 3\'{}side (BR)
    \item internal loops (IL)
    \item multiloops (ML).

   \begin{block}{\small new algorithm should be:}
   \begin{itemize}
     \item develop a new algorithm for RNA secondary structures which keeps
     track of the position of structural elements
     \item be implemented in the framework of ''Abstract shapes of RNA''
     \item be evaluated and compared to existing algorithms
     \item The new algorithm will be used to design prediction strategies for
     various classes of RNAs
   \end{itemize}

    \item possible different helices type
    
    \item The energy of a particular base pair in a double stranded regions is
    sequence independent, that is, Neighbors do not influence the energy.
    
    
    - In this algorithm, we have to assume one condition, namely we get away the knots from the calculation.
  The reason why we can get away the knots from the calculation is the calculation result of secondary structure prediction are used to infer
  3-dimensional structures and knots can be inferred at this stage as well.
